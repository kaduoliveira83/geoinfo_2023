The GeoInfo 2023 Conference Research Repository contains a paper titled "Traffic Congestion Prediction Using Time Series: A Comparison of LSTM and Prophet". 

The paper investigates the use of time series analysis to predict traffic congestion. It compares two methodologies, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Prophet, using data from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) in California. The results show that LSTM is more efficient than Prophet for traffic prediction. Future research plans to investigate other time series prediction models applied to road network structure.
